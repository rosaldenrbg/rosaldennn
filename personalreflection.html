<h2>INTEGRITY, COMPASSION, AND EXCELLENCE</h2>

    <br>
    <br>
    <h3>integgrity teaches me to be honest with myself and with other. It reminds that doing what is right is more important than doing what is easy. whether I am completing schoolwork, participating in activities, or interacting with people, I try to choose honesty and fairness. Integrity means staying true my values even when no one is watching, and it helps me build trust with the people around me.
    <br>
    <br>
    Compassion is a values thathelps me understand and care for others. It reminds me that everyone carries their own struggles, and sometimes a small act of kindness can make a big difference. by showing empathy, listening to others, and offering help when ican, I become more connested to my community.
    <br>
    <br>
    excellence, for me, means striving to become better every day. it's not about being perfect, but about giving my best effort in everything I do. Excellence motivates me to work hard, stay desciplined and continuously learn. It pushes me to improve my skills, achieve my goals, and become a stronger version of myself.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    These Values, INTEGRITY, COMPASSION, AND EXCELLENCE work together to guide my growth.
