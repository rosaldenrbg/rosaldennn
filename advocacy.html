<h2>"BEING THE LIGHT OF THE WORLD"<h2>

    <br>
    <br>
    <h3>As a Lux Mundi student of Tangub City Global College, I believe that each of us carries a purpose far greater than ourselves. "Lux Mundi", which means Light og the World, is not just a little , it is a calling. It reminds us that in everything we do, we must choose to shine, to lead, and to create positive change within our community.
    <br>
    <br>
     To live out this light through service, compassion and responsible action. In a world where many struggle with challenges such as poverty, misinformation, and lack of opportunities, w as students have the power to ifluence others through simple acts of kindness, community involvement, and dedication to our studies. by being disciplined learners today, we become capable leaders tomorrow.
     <br>
     <br>
     I advocate for a community where every student becomes a beacon of hope. some one who uplifts others rather than judges them; someone who shares knowledge instead of representative of Tangub City Global College, we are called to embody integrity, honesty and service in all our
     <br>
     <br>
     Being "Light of the World" means choosing to inspire rather than discourage, to help rather than ignore, and to lead rather than follow negativity. It means taking part in programs that benefit the city, promoting environmental responsibility, respecting diversity, and supporting the growth of fellow students.
     <br>
     <br>
     Through this advocacy, I commit to shining my light not for recognition, but for the betterment of my community. As a Luxmundi studennt, I will continue to be a guiding light on that sparks hope, encourages change, and reminds others that the smallest light can brighten the darkest place.
     <br>
     <br>
     TOGETHER, AS TANGUB CITY GLOBAL COLLEGE STUDENTS, LET US SHINE, NOT JUST FOR OURSELVES, BUT FOR THE WORLD.
