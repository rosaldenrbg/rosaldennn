FAITH AND TECHNOLOGY

<h2>"STUDENT'S LIFE"<h2>

    <br>
    <br>
   <h3>Faith and technology integration is about using modern technology in a way that reflects our personal values, beliefs, and ethical principles. As a 19years old first year Computer Studies student who came from ABM strand learning technology feels both challenging and inspiring. i may not have much knowledge yet about coding or computer concepts, but my faith give me strength to believe in my ability to grow and adapt. faith reminds me to stay patient, courageous, and hopeful even when lessons feel difficult. 

In todays generation, technology is part of every student's life — from Learning how to code, creating websites, researching, and communicating. by integrating faith, we use technology not just for convenience, but for growth, positivity and meaningful impact. 

we can combine our faith with technology to improve learning, communicate positively, and contribute to our communities. This can mean using the internet and digital tools to explore spiritual teachings, create projects or websites that inspire others, and share knowledge responsibly. It also encourages us to use social media and apps wisely, making sure our online actions align with our beliefs. By integrating faith with technology, we learn to balance the benefits of digital tools with moral guidance, helping us grow not only academically but also spiritually and personally. In this way, technology becomes more than just a tool—it becomes a way to express our values, serve others, and make a positive impact on the world.</h3>
