<h3>MY MEANINGFUL EXPERIENCES</h3>

     <br>
    <br>
   <h3> My Journey as a students has been by courage, passion, and the willingness to try new things even when the outcomes is uncertain. In 2025, I experienced one of my proudest moments, becoming First Runner Up in CHEERDANCE for the very first time. this achievement was not just about winning a place, but about proving to myself that dedication, teamwork and discipline can create unforgettable success.\
    <br>
    <br>
    Before this, my High school years were filled with determination as I worked hard to become an achiever student. I always believed that education is the key to bulding a better future, and every accomplishment reminded me that perserverance truly matters.
    <br>
    <br>
    one of my most meaningful experineces was being a Sinulog dancer in Baroy, Lanao Del Norte, where our group was crowned Champion. Performing in Sinulog Taught me the value of cultural pride, unity, and dedication. it was a powerful reminder that talent shines brightest when we honor our roots and give our whole heart what we do.
    <br>
    <br>
    At the age of 16, i also stepped out of my comfort zone  when I joined the Screening for Miss Baroy 2022. even though i did not make it to the final selection, the experience taught me one of the greates lessons in life, that trying already a form of success. i learned to embrace challenges, grow from rejection, and trust in my own potential.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    All of these experiences shaped me into someone braver, stronger, and more detemined, my journey is proof that sucess comes not only from winning, but also from learning, ecporing new opportunities, and believing in oneself. I continue striving to become a better version of myself for my FUTURE, for my FAMILY and for my dreams i hold close to my heart.
